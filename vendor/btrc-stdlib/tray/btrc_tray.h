/*
 * btrc standard library — native system tray / menu-bar runtime (C ABI).
 *
 * A dependency-free native status item: on macOS it drives Cocoa's
 * NSStatusBar/NSStatusItem/NSMenu (linked with -framework Cocoa); on Linux it
 * speaks the StatusNotifierItem + dbusmenu spec over D-Bus (the de-facto
 * Wayland/freedesktop systray) using only base system D-Bus. No third-party
 * libraries.
 *
 * The OS owns the icon + menu and draws them natively (GPU-composited by the
 * window server). Command execution is intentionally left to the caller: when a
 * menu item is activated the runtime records the item's opaque command string,
 * and the btrc side (Tray/SystemTray in tray.btrc) pumps the event loop and
 * runs that command through the existing Command/UnixShell stdlib.
 *
 * The public API uses only C primitives and `char*` to match btrc codegen
 * (handles are opaque void*; `string` lowers to `char*`).
